# Application of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to structural optimization

Abstract
The thesis concerns the application of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
algorithm to the optimization of truss structures. The applied algorithm can be 
included in the class of new non-deterministic methods of global optimization inspired 
by nature. In the first part of the work the optimization definitions and the basic 
numerical methods used for searching best solutions are described. The next part 
presents the PSO algorithm â€“ its history, the way how it works and its possible 
applications. Then basic notions of the finite element method are introduced and the 
truss elements used in the optimized constructions are presented in details. There 
are also some information concerning the FEM program created to analyze the 
equilibrium of the truss structures. The PSO optimization and the FEM programs 
written in Scilab environment are used to determine the optimal solutions. The PSO 
algorithm was created to work with continuous or discrete variables of the 
optimization problem. Next part of the thesis presents test results of both programs. 
In the final part the resulting procedures used to the optimization of two-dimensional
truss structures are shown. Presented numerical examples concern the problem of 
the mass minimisation under stress and deflection constraints. The plane truss, the 
simple bridge model and the arch structure were analyzed and the optimal results 
obtained for different formulations of the optimization problem were discussed. The 
last part of the thesis includes the analysis of the efficiency of the procedure, the 
numerical aspects of the developed code, and possibilities of improvement and 
development of the program.
